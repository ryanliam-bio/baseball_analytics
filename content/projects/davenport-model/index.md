Back in my final year of college, I rediscovered my love for baseball through the lens of statistics. I had read about game-by-game modeling using Pythagorean Win % and this was my initial effort at making such a model, using 2021 pre-June data (simply because that's when I did this work). 

There are no less than 47 ways I could have done this better (using more than 2 months of data, cleaning up bullpen estimated strength, reducing starter inning assumptions, etc.) but this first foray into statistical analysis was the foundation for my final semester's data science project- an evaluation of full season results compared to modeled win %.
