## AL MVP

</div>
This is a true 2 horse race, with Aaron Judge putting up another monster offensive season to the tune of 7.4 fWAR and a 219 wRC+. He tops the league in xwOBA, is tied for the lead in PitcherList’s Process+ (a blended metric evaluating swing decisions, contact, and power), and is playing above average defense to boot. There really aren’t many nits to pick in his candidacy or weaknesses to highlight outside of a rough 2 weeks in late June.

The only reason this is even a contest is because Cal Raleigh is putting up one of the best catcher seasons we’ve seen in recent memory. In a year where we’ve seen a catcher eclipse 6.0 fWAR only 4 times in the last decade, he sits comfortably at 6.2 WAR with a league leading 38 home runs. His first half performance has inspired conversations about whether we need new metrics to properly capture catcher value (Eno Sarris + Trevor May, Rates & Barrels podcast June 18) given the days off required for a catcher to hold up over the course of a full season. Keep an eye on Harry Ford in the second half, as he continues to show solid numbers in AAA and could give Seattle another dependable catching option if they want to give Cal a more regular breather at DH going forward. While most xStats mark Cal as a decent overperformer to this point, this isn’t a profile that we should expect to come crashing down to Earth in a ball of fire. His 37.9% Pull Air% leads the league, indicating that he is making the most of his “pull and lift” approach, regardless which side of the plate he’s swinging from. The singular poor indicator I would highlight for Cal is that, according to PitcherList’s Pitch Runs (an estimator of pitch quality faced), there are only 6 hitters in baseball who have seen an easier array of pitches across this season (min. 500 pitches). It is a newer metric so I’m taking it with a small grain of salt, but Kyle Bland is about as sharp as they come and the entire PL analytical suite has been incredibly valuable. After his recent Home Run Derby win, it seems that “Big Dumper” has cemented himself as a national fan favorite and will have the narrative winds at his back, but it is unlikely that would be enough to overcome another elite >200 wRC+ season from Judge.

## NL MVP

</div>

Shohei Ohtani is the best player on the planet. Coming off a 2023 internal brace procedure and 2024 arthroscopic labrum surgery, he showed no signs of rust with a 176 wRC+ entering July, before slowing down to a pedestrian 108 in the 50 PA ahead of the All Star Break- for what little that's worth. More importantly in recent weeks, however, he made his successful return to the mound and has ramped up to 3 innings of work earlier. Time will tell how his rehab continues but, by all appearances, he is still the same dominant arm we saw as a Cy Young contender in 2022. If he continues his trajectory as a top 5 hitter and an elite starter through the last 65 games of the season, it’s hard to see a path to victory for any contenders.

However, if he falters, there are a number of worthy candidates lined up to take advantage. Pete Crow-Armstrong has increased his xwOBA by 71 points year over year to make himself a top 30 offensive threat while maintaining his status as one of the absolute best defenders in baseball. He is the only 20/20 hitter thus far and has surpassed both of those numbers with room to spare. He’s solidly ahead of Ohtani in both WAR metrics. There really aren’t any huge indicators he’s due for regression soon, but his league leading (derogatory) chase rate gives some pause when paired with a middling contact%. Rob Mains noted in a recent BaseballProspectus article how difficult it is to find long-term success while striking out as much and walking as little as PCA does, though he’s certainly made it work these first 100 games and has put himself firmly in the MVP race as a young 23-year-old. My guess is that he will be one of the more volatile hitters in baseball thanks to his low OBP/high slug profile, but his speed will continue to earn him top-tier value as a baserunner and a fielder.  

Pete’s teammate Kyle Tucker keeps churning out star-level seasons as a multi-category contributor, dispelling any questions around his offseason health concerns. Frankly, there isn’t much more to say here. He’s not really over or underperforming significantly, his plate approach is still elite, and his only real knock is a nasty little slump heading into the break. Tucker’s production rises and falls steadily with his rolling ground ball rate and I wouldn’t read into it much more than that. He’s a solid tertiary option right now. 

Fernando Tatis. Jr, James Wood, and Francisco Lindor can all be considered fringe contenders as well with top 15 WAR marks. Tatis is underperforming his xwOBA because of his brutally poor 11.5% Pull-Air%. He’s been lifting the ball much better in the last two months but still is not pulling the ball effectively. The RF defense is still top-notch but he likely isn’t a true threat until/unless the pull power comes back. Lindor is having another All-Star caliber, albeit unexciting, season and would need a historic second half to separate himself from the other stars on the Mets. James Wood is showing out impressively for his age 22 season with a deserved 152 wRC+ on a bad Nats team. The underlying numbers show he is well on his way to superstardom but it may be a year too early.

Further down the WAR leaderboard, Juan Soto was declared “a bust”, “an unmitigated disaster”, and “un-Soto” in the month of May. In fairness, he “only” had a 124 wRC+ entering the month of June while playing some of the worst defense of his career. Granted, those quotes were from Barstool, CBS, and Reddit, but you’d think Juan Soto was 2023 Javy Baez with how the early days of his Mets tenure were reported. However, these early struggles were largely the result of a .224 BABIP (9th percentile) and he has been the best hitter in baseball since the start of June. Everything under the hood still points to this guy being the same generational offensive talent we’ve seen dominate for the last 7 years. He is the biggest qualified underperformer of xwOBA this year and, while it wouldn’t be a surprise to see him underperform slightly as a result of his low Pull-Air%, there should be more positive BABIP regression coming his way to end the season. He’s raised his Pull-Air% to solidly above average in the last two months, any continuation should result in an scorching hot second half. 

Ketel Marte and Ronald Acuña Jr. missed significant amounts of time early on but have both picked up where they left off as top 10 hitters. RAJ is more than likely dead as he missed the first ~2 months of the season, but Marte has kept himself in the T-25 in WAR/oRAR despite missing almost the entire month of April. In the immortal words of Miracle Max, mostly dead is still slightly alive. Probably nothing there but worth keeping an eye on.

## AL Cy Young

</div>

Tarik Skubal is the best pitcher on the planet. He leads the AL in WAR, is tied for the lead in ERA, has the best K-BB% and SIERA by margin, and is projected to end the year with a ~2.4 ERA. He has been utterly dominant, challenging hitters with the 5th highest Zone% and the 2nd best Contact% in baseball. He was a unanimous CY winner last year and has improved in just about every way this year. There remains some concern around his ability to hold up through the full season after throwing 211 innings between regular and postseason last year, particularly with an extra tick or two of velo on all of his pitches, but betting against Skubal on his expected performance would be ill-advised.

That’s not to say he’s without competition- Garrett Crochet actually holds a small RA9-WAR lead over Skubal. He pitches in a tougher park and has worse underlying numbers but would be a solid favorite in any non-Skubal world. At first glance I would expect some positive regression on the .291 BABIP, though that could be a function of his fastball-heavy approach (82.3% 4S/cutter/sinker).

Behind Crochet is a sizable tier gap to Hunter Brown, Jacob DeGrom, Max Fried, Framber Valdez, and… Nathan Eovaldi? Despite missing almost the entirety of June with triceps tightness, Eovaldi remains near the top of the board in RA9-WAR, CYP, and SIERA. Dan Szymborski’s zStats (like xStats but ZiPS version) names Eovaldi, Fried, Brown, and Crochet all as FIP overachievers to this point while Framber continues to outperform his xStats as a result of his elite GB%. I need to see more consistent command of the Knuckle Curve (being his only real secondary option) from Hunter Brown to really buy in but the floor is high with 3 above average fastballs. I struggle to see a pathway for Fried because of his relatively poor K-BB%/SIERA in that park, though there should be no shortage of wins (for whatever that is still worth). DeGrom has posted his worst strikeout numbers in a decade this year, likely as a result of his hopeful velo for innings tradeoff, but both his velo and strikeout numbers have been steadily increasing over the last month or so.
 
<div style="text-align: center;">

## NL Cy Young

</div>

Similar to AL Cy Young, this is mostly a 2 horse race with a mess of names behind the top dogs. While they are tied in bWAR and effectively even in CYP/FIP CYP, Paul Skenes holds a small lead over Zack Wheeler in RA9-WAR thanks to a 2.01 ERA over 121 innings to Wheeler’s 2.36 in 122. Wheeler gets more whiffs and issues fewer walks, while Skenes induces worse contact (lower barrels/BBE and xwOBAcon) despite a higher hard hit%. SIERA strongly prefers Wheeler’s performance to date- likely due to the 5.9% gap in K-BB%. These two are neck and neck across the board, with one key difference. Skenes is running a 5.9% HR/FB% (10.6% last year) and Wheeler’s 12.0% would be an 8 year high. There is a small gap to be expected given the home parks of each pitcher and the minute difference in barrels allowed, but both numbers should regress towards each other through the final 65 games. 

Behind our frontrunners are a few pitchability specialists. Cristopher Sanchez is the strongest contender of the group and may deserve his own tier based on to-date performance. 4th in the league in bWAR, 6th in fWAR, 7th in SIERA- it’s all there for the Phillies’ number 2.  He’s bumped the strikeout rate up to 26% while maintaining 95th percentile ground ball rate. His velocity has dipped a little throughout the year but there doesn’t seem to be any negative effect as his FIP has steadily improved month over month. I do not believe in Matthew Boyd and I believe most of his success has come from Wrigley limiting home runs. He does deserve credit for his top 5 ERA and CYP standing thus far but none of the underlying numbers point to this being especially sustainable. Logan Webb was a strong contender early on as he showed 30% strikeout rate in the first month of the season, only to back off his Sweeper and Cutter in favor of his traditional sinker/change approach. 6 ER in 5 innings vs the Dodgers last time out really pushed him down the RA9-WAR leaderboard as his ERA “ballooned” to 2.94 but the underlying numbers are still strong. He’s shown the strikeout ability, the home park will always support him, and he projects quite well ROS, but that gap is quickly approaching insurmountable. Mackenzie Gore and Sonny Gray have shown better K-BB% and fWAR figures than the three listed above, but neither project especially well and would require a helluva runout to surpass Wheeler/Skenes. 
 
<div style="text-align: center;">

## NL Rookie of the Year

</div>

Without any contender willing to build a serious lead over the first 100 games of the season, Jacob Misiorowski has dominated his first month in the big leagues and taken pole position in this Rookie of the Year race. Armed with arguably the nastiest non-reliever Stuff in baseball (99th percentile velo and extension), he’s thrown 25 innings of 2.81 ERA baseball with a 33.7% strikeout rate. Most notably, he’s kept the walks in check and his 57.9% Zone% and 11.2% BB% are the best numbers he’s shown at any level of professional baseball. The stuff will eat hitters alive if he can live in the zone and it’s not hard to see how he could quickly run away with the award, despite not crossing the 0.5 fWAR mark.

However, there is a little cold water to be thrown as Misiorowski is only 8.1 innings away from his career high. There is a real chance he has starts skipped in the 2H, at which point one or two blow-up games would likely be fatal. If that happens, Drake Baldwin is sitting just shy of 2 WAR and would be the most likely winner by default. Despite some ups and downs, he’s been solidly above average offensively and defensively playing backup to Sean Murphy. There’s been plenty of chatter around a prospective Sean Murphy trade with Atlanta almost entirely eliminated from playoff contention, which would set up enough runway for Baldwin to put this race out of reach. Beyond Baldwin are some of the most unexciting, but still productive, candidates you’ll find. Caleb Durbin and Isaac Collins are slightly above average hitters who have gotten pretty regular playing time in Milwaukee and are sitting around 1.5 WAR (though Durbin is marginally ahead of Baldwin at 2.0 bWAR). Ben Casparius had a brief opportunity to prove himself in the Dodgers rotation, only to give up 6 ER in consecutive appearances and be relegated back to the bullpen. Hyeseong Kim has done well to amass 1.1/1.7 f/bWAR in very limited playing time but the xwOBA/hard hit numbers suggest his well over his skis offensively right now. Chase Burns has put together a pair of really quality starts (10.2 IP, 17K, 3ER) after a nasty 5 ER in only 0.1 IP in Boston, but with how late he was called up that implosion is likely a killshot. He has comparable Stuff to Misiorowski and is worth keeping an eye on given his ace potential- I’d just like it a lot better if he weren’t pitching in homer-prone Cincinnati. Finally, Chad Patrick did well to cement himself on top of both NL WAR leaderboards and bumped his Stuff+ numbers from 99 in April to 110 in June, only to be demoted amidst Milwaukee’s rotation squeeze. He has the WAR banked to be competitive if he returns soon but he’s far from the only one fighting for a spot back at American Family Field. 
 
<div style="text-align: center;">

## AL Rookie of the Year

</div>

Jacob Wilson took the league by storm to start the year, posting a 160 wRC+ and 3.1 fWAR through June 8th. His slash line of .372/.408/.528 while striking out only 6% of the time. 8 home runs for a guy with 30 grade present game power was unreal, especially as he lived up to the 70 grade future hit tool and then some. He fits perfectly into the Luis Arraez/Steven Kwan slow bat speed + elite squared up % bucket, with comparable Fast Swing and Blast rates. Unlike Arraez, however, Wilson plays a premium defensive position which only strengthened his candidacy. He is a contact savant and seems to put the ball exactly where it needs to be every time. However, the profile is not sustainable. Even with the friendly ballpark in Sacramento, there is no indication that he will continue anywhere near this level of power. No matter what metric you use, JW is one of the biggest overperformers in baseball. While the gap has shrunk over the last month, his wOBA is 56 points above his 28th percentile xwOBA (.309). The next closest player is Zach McKinstry at 36 points over. True contact hitters like Arraez and Kwan do frequently outperform their expected numbers- this gap is just unreasonable when combined with Wilson’s 27th percentile pull-air%. Going back to ZiPS, zStats marks him for 3.0 expected home runs compared to his actual count of 9. To top it off, while FanGraphs gives him credit for being a perfectly average SS (which is still somewhat valuable), DRS marks him the worst defensive shortstop in baseball. While this discrepancy deserves its own conversation another day, the defensive value is a big reason why Jacob Wilson no longer holds the top spot on the bWAR rookie leaderboard. Since June 8th (completely arbitrary date)*, Jacob Wilson has a 58 wRC+ and a 12% strikeout rate, good for -0.2 WAR. Most of this can certainly be chalked up to bad luck (.247 BABIP) and a few new/nagging minor injuries, but that is what the floor looks like for a guy who does not have the bat speed to consistently inflict damage on contact.

That top WAR spot, perhaps surprisingly, belongs to Carlos Narváez. The 26-year-old rookie catcher for the Red Sox has been an above-average offensive contributor and one of the most valuable defenders in baseball. He is the only rookie above 3.0 bWAR and just 0.1 fWAR behind Jacob Wilson (2.8), despite not being one of the 9 qualified catchers this year. Unfortunately, this is another offensive profile that doesn’t seem to be particularly sustainable as Carlos is right behind the aforementioned Mr. Wilson and McKinstry on the xwOBA overperformer list. There is a bit more juice to this profile as he’s shown the ability to consistently pull and lift the ball in a hitter friendly park, but that BABIP should regress a bit closer to .300 as we move forward. 

Staying in Boston, Roman Anthony has quickly gotten his feet under him offensively after an understandably slow debut. He’s hovering around 1.0 WAR in his first 124 PA and has shown to be a solidly positive right fielder, though he’s played 1/3 of his games at DH. His hard hit, walk, and chase numbers already look elite. He may be the next superstar at Fenway and the question is really just how quickly he will be able to adjust to new gameplans from opposing pitchers, as any prolonged slump would likely leave him dead in the water.

Similarly, Nick Kurtz has managed to grind out 1.2/1.5 f/bWAR in 235 PA despite playing some of the worst 1B defense in baseball. The present 35 hit tool scouting grade seems to be accurate as evidenced by his 33.7% strikeout rate and 27th percentile xBA, but Kurtz has quickly grown into his 60 future power grade and is tied for 2nd in baseball with 12 home runs (170 wRC+) since returning from the IL on June 9th. This coincides with a significant month-over-month increase in Pull-Air%, painting a picture of a young hitter quickly learning how to access his power in-game most effectively. He is still flirting with the bottom 10 in Contact % but when he connects, he does damage. Robert Orr’s SEAGER leaderboard marks him 99th percentile in Damage/BBE and 86th in SEAGER (a swing decision metric that goes beyond simply zone swing/chase). There isn’t much of any reason to expect Kurtz to stop mashing, even if he was also named on the zStats home run overperformer leaderboard, because everything he hits is absolutely scalded (97th percentile xwOBAcon). As with any high-whiff slugger, your main hope in betting against Kurtz is that the usual rookie adjustments take longer than expected, because when the slumps come the defensive anchor can quickly drag him down. 

Jasson Dominguez is a candidate in name value only.

Finally, the last real contender in my eyes is Cam Smith. A very raw talent, he made the Opening Day roster after being drafted and playing just 32 MiLB games in 2024. He’s been a slightly above-average hitter and a slightly negative fielder per FanGraphs (but a T25 fielder by DRS). At face value, neither of those are particularly exciting. However, he opened his swing significantly in mid-May and has been considerably better since with a 131 wRC+. There are still very much some growing pains to be had, as evidenced by his 2.9% Pull-Air% in July following a June in which he was at 20%. His 90th percentile max EV, 15th percentile pulled FB%, and 39th percentile SEAGER are all hallmarks of an inexperienced rookie learning on the job. He continues to lift the ball more, but recently those fly balls and line drives have been going to the opposite field much more often. Further shown by his deeper contact point this last month, it seems Cam is letting the ball travel too deep instead of attacking the ball to pull it authoritatively in the last month. How quickly he’s able to make this adjustment will determine this ROY race, though it should be more of a plate approach issue rather than a mechanical one. He sits squarely in the mix at 1.9 fWAR and 2.2 bWAR and has the tools to take off- if he can put it together in time. 


<div style="text-align: center;">

## TL:DR 

</div>

AL MVP- almost certainly Judge unless he slumps for a month (possible), I think fatigue will be a major concern for Cal down the stretch. All my positions are dead. 

NL MVP- probably Shohei? But the performance has been steadily declining since mid-May and if Soto keeps improving his pulled FB mix, he could just Judge level nuke 2H. No faith in PCA, Tucker could challenge if nobody improves, too early for Wood IMO, Tatis needs to *really* start pulling the ball but he has the tools, no faith in Lindor. Ketel needs an injury or two but could be a sneaky contender. I am HEAVY Soto w/ little bits of Wood, Tucker, Lindor at various points to cover my ass and a lot of dead Carroll/others.

AL CY- Skubal slightly ahead, Crochet a bit less of a fatigue/injury worry for me, DeGrom might be ramping up to old peak? Small preseason DeGrom, Hunter, Woo, Joe Ryan in pocket. Expecting to take the L but watching DeGrom and may add.

NL CY- feels like Cole 2023 for Wheeler but Skenes about dead even right now. Lots of likely dead Webb in pocket, decent preseason Cris, small flyer on Sonny, decent bite of Robbie Ray probably dead but hanging tier 3.

AL ROY- continuing to heavy fade JW. Cam Smith BIG in pocket, small Kurtz in preseason RR will cover my portfolio because his Process+ numbers are crazy, Chase Meidroth big swing dead w Kristian Campbell, Chandler Simpson, Alan Roden. Like Carthage of old, praying on the downfall of the Roman Empire. 

NL ROY- who even knows? Decent Misiorowski in pocket at callup, Baldwin has been a RR staple in the last month, plenty of Hyeseong probably dead, good pop on Burns probably dead but still watching. Matt Shaw is not a serious candidate.
